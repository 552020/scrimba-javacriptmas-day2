## Snow by Zachary

And **[here](https://codepen.io/zachstronaut/pen/wHdrq)** you can find the code I blataly copied to generate the snow. Thanks to [Zachary Johnson](https://twitter.com/zacharyjohnson).

## Take-aways

It's the first time I 'used' jQuery. The challenge was to integrate this jQuery code I've no idea what it means with the rest of the code without breaking everything. And for that I'm really proud of myself.

I didn't manage to stop the function which generate the snow flakes, when you hit again on Christmas.
